                    <p>People are now dependent on technology. In this dynamic life, people want to speed up their life,
                        and that is why they need advanced technology. They need technology that will save time and
                        reduce physical labour. They also want to get rid of the small household works. This Smart
                        window is these types of innovation which can work automatically, can reduce physical effort,
                        ensure safeness in your house or office and it’s easy to use and also the setup cost is very
                        low. This system is buildup with seven sensors. A user can also control this system, or you can
                        switch to the Automatic on that case the system will work automatically. If the gas and smoke
                        sensor detect gas and smoke this system will take action like opening the window and turn off
                        the gas line with alarming. You will get all the information on your smartphone. If you want to
                        close your window manually by using the app, you can close the window form your bed.</p>

                            <br>
                            <!-- <div class="subheading mb-3">Intelitec Solutions</div> -->
                            <p>This work examines the method of classification of road surface based on backscattered
                                ultrasonic signal analysis. The fancy of our study is the extraction of signal features
                                for individual sections (sectioning) of the illuminated surface and the widespread use
                                of statistics in real-way and off-road driving conditions. Defects caused by the impact
                                of environmental conditions and the movement of vehicles were, analysed, and ways to
                                reduce them were suggested. The results demonstrate the feasibility of reliable surface
                                classification using the proposed methodology. The current demand and the still-unsolved
                                challenge is to provide remote real-time identification of road surface conditions in
                                both complex environments (off-road terrain, liquid dirt etc.) and weather conditions
                                (rain, spray, fog, snow etc.). In this paper, the feasibility of a short-range
                                ultrasonic sensing system is investigated. Along with other sensor technologies such as
                                infrared, radar, LIDAR and visible light, the use of ultrasonic signal for surface
                                classification by roughness and surface textures has been investigated in many
                                studies.</p>

                            <br>
                            <p>Speech recognition is now an area where a lot of research is being done. Our main goal is
                                to have emotion Detection by voice through the machine for Bangla language.
                                Bangla-Voice-DB is a database by which we can detect emotions. This database is the
                                gender balance where the audio clip of 20 actors has been collected. All the voices have
                                been recorded in the ongoing Bengali language where eight types of emotions can detect.
                                Speech includes neutral, calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise, and disgust
                                expressions. Every actor has recorded 60 audio clips and each clip has been recorded for
                                eight emotions, with eight different counters each. Total estimates have been made from
                                1200 recordings of 20 people. In this paper, we used the high pass filter to get good
                                results. High pass filter is used to remove noise. Feature extraction is very important
                                for our paper, so we used mel Frequency cepstrum coefficient (MFCC) as feature
                                extraction. We have followed two methods as a feature selection, first, we have used the
                                random forest. We didn’t get very good results from the random forest, Then we used the
                                neural network to achieve good results as our main classifier is a feasible technique
                                for the emotional classification. The results show that the neural network used as a
                                classifier is a potential technique for emotional classification.</p>

                            <br>
                            <p>Offline handwritten character recognition is a process where a machine will recognize
                                what is written in an image of handwritten script. We are going to recognize doctor’s
                                handwriting from a prescription. So the selection of a good feature extraction method is
                                the most important factor. Because if we want to achieve high recognition performance
                                with much better accuracy we must have to select good feature extraction method. We want
                                to develop an OCR agent which will detect doctor’s handwriting from prescription. Our
                                main target is building a medicine website where people will upload their prescription
                                image and our agent will detect out the medicine names. So to do that we have to apply
                                various techniques to extract information from images. Image Processing, Machine
                                Learning, and Machine Translation are some key part of our project.</p>

                        <p>This work examines the method of classification of road surface based on backscattered
                            ultrasonic signal analysis. The fancy of our study is the extraction of signal features for
                            individual sections (sectioning) of the illuminated surface and the widespread use of
                            statistics in real-way and off-road driving conditions. Defects caused by the impact of
                            environmental conditions and the movement of vehicles were, analysed, and ways to reduce
                            them were suggested. The results demonstrate the feasibility of reliable surface
                            classification using the proposed methodology. The current demand and the still-unsolved
                            challenge is to provide remote real-time identification of road surface conditions in both
                            complex environments (off-road terrain, liquid dirt etc.) and weather conditions (rain,
                            spray, fog, snow etc.). In this paper, the feasibility of a short-range ultrasonic sensing
                            system is investigated. Along with other sensor technologies such as infrared, radar, LIDAR
                            and visible light, the use of ultrasonic signal for surface classification by roughness and
                            surface textures has been investigated in many studies.</p>

                        <p>This is my first project. The main idea of the project is to pick up some obstacle. This
                            small car can be used in Army or Industrial. Like the can be controlled with controller and
                            detect a bomb or unusual thing that can be harmful for any human that time this car can go
                            that place with the support of the live video stream and can pick up the unusual thing to
                            move somewhere else like if we think of the bomb, this could be useful.</p>
